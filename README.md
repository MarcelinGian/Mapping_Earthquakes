# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary
### In this challenge I used Javasript and d3 to map earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plate location on the earth. In addition to the All Earthquakes category I Included a seperate layer for earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 for a total of 3 overlayed features with 2 optional tile layers.
